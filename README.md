# YayPentestMagiskModuleYay
Custom Magisk Module that does various tasks on the device for pentest purposes

* Move CA certificates from the User store to the System store
* Add a `frida-server` binary to the device and run it

Latest build is in the Releases section

If you want to modify the logic of this module:

* `post-fs-data.sh` contains most of the logic for the module itself
* `service.sh` ensures `frida-server` continues to run

If you want to build your own module, or if you want to build a version with newer `frida-server` binaries, then:

`python3 ./build.py`

The build script will automatically download the latest `frida-server` binaries for `arm`, `arm64`, `x86`, and `x86_64`

TODO:

* Implement a `zygisk` module to enable screenshots for every activity
* Auto install LSPosed
