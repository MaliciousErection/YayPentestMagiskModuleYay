if you don't want to copy certs from user store to system store, and instead want to just directly install certs into system store, place certs into this folder

to generate a proper cert:

~$ openssl x509 -inform DER -in cacert.der -out cacert.pem
~$ export yaynameyay=$(openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in cacert.pem |head -1)
~$ cp cacert.pem $yaynameyay.0

place the ".0" file in this folder
